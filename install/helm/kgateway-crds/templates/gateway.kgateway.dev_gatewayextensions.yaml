                              the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
                              implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of
                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no

                              weights does not need to equal 100.

                              If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
                              of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
